								<h2>JUP DAO Townhall #1</h2>
								<p>Key takeaways from the JupDAO Townhall</p>
							</header>
			<br>

			

			<h2>Working Groups: The Foundation of JupDAO</h2><hr><br>
			<p>The core working group emphasized its role in creating a productive environment for the DAO. By
				providing the right incentives, tools, and processes, they aim to empower community members to
				engage and influence the DAO effectively. The townhall also highlighted the existence of other
				working groups, each focusing on specific areas such as content creation and community engagement.
				New working groups can be formed by community members who are passionate about contributing to
				different aspects of JupDAO.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>LFG Process: A Success Story</h2><hr><br>
			<p>The LFG process was a significant topic of discussion. With over 180,000 wallets participating, the
				projects involved in the vote saw substantial benefits, including increased social media followers
				and valuable feedback for their marketing strategies. The townhall addressed questions about
				handling projects that didn't launch in the first round and the possibility of not having six viable
				candidates for future rounds. The community's feedback is being collected to refine and improve the
				LFG process further.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Future Plans: Shaping the DAO</h2><hr><br>
			<p>Looking ahead, the townhall explored how the DAO might handle projects that didn't launch in the
				first round. Options include allowing them to automatically ascend to the second round or requiring
				them to start back at the forum process. The community's input is crucial in making these decisions,
				and the DAO is committed to transparency and inclusivity in its planning.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Community Involvement: The Heart of JupDAO</h2><hr><br>
			<p>The townhall emphasized the importance of community involvement in the DAO. Members were encouraged
				to participate in discussions, contribute to working groups, and engage in voting. The DAO values
				the diverse perspectives and ideas brought by its members and sees community involvement as
				essential to its success.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Project Introductions: Innovations in the Pipeline</h2><hr><br>
			<p>Two new projects were introduced for the second round of the LFG process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Sanctum:</strong> Aiming to build infinite liquid staking tokens, Sanctum has been
					instrumental in developing liquid staking solutions on Solana. Their goal is to enhance
					liquidity and accessibility for staked tokens across the network.</li>
				<li><strong>Ad Astra:</strong> Focused on creating high-performance DeFi strategies tailored for
					Jupiter and other DEXes, Ad Astra seeks to leverage Jupiter Liquidity Pool (JLP) and other
					assets to provide innovative yield opportunities for investors.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2><hr><br>
			<p>The JupDAO Townhall on March 14, 2024, provided valuable insights into the DAO's progress, future
				plans, and the importance of community involvement. As JupDAO continues to evolve, the collective
				efforts of its members and working groups will be key to its success. The DAO looks forward to more
				community participation and innovative projects in the upcoming LFG rounds.</p>
